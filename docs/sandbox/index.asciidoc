:skip-front-matter:
= Machinekit Sandbox

This is a try out zone for articles, blogs, wiki type docs
on any Machinekit related subject that does not easily fit
into the existing document tree.

It allows them to be visible and shared, whilst the 
maintainers decide upon the best home for them.

== How to contribute.

Whilst on this page click on the 'Edit this Page' link

Uncomment (remove the // preceding) the next free link template
and change it to relate to your article

eg.
[source, html]
----
- link:unused01[Robohand Blog - 20-05-2016]
----

Then submit the change via the Pull Request button.

This will let the maintainers know you will be posting an article soon
on that link and the regeneration of the site will make the link
you edited visible.

Once the PR is approved and site has regenerated, return to this page.

Your link will be visible, so click on it and you will get a blank template page.

Use the 'Edit this Page' link again to edit the page and enter your article
in asciidoc format.

Commit as a PR again and before long your article will be visible to all !
