= Updating your fork

When the original repo changed, and you want to make modifications it is wise
to first update your fork with the changes from upstream. That way you will make
changes on top of other contributions. That way it will be easier to automatically
merge your update.

here's how to do that.

- notice the message `This branch is 30 commits behind machinekit:master`? That's
because changes have been done to the Machinekit website after I forked it, or
after my last `PR`. In other words `machinekit:master` is more recent and I do
not have the latest modifications.

- Pushing the green compare for pull-request button will give me following screen.
Notice the original (purple) and forked (green) branch and the "switching the
base" link:

- Follow the link and notice the repo's have been reversed.

- Create the `PR` by pushing the green button. This means you are going to do
a `PR` to your own fork and get the changes from the original. Enter a
descriptive commit message.

- Scroll down and create the `PR`. Then next thing you'll know you are at your
own fork, having a PR to confirm.

- Scroll down and "merge" this PR in your fork.

*Congratulations, you just updated your fork!*

Now that you're up-to-date you can do link:/docs/documenting[back] to
editing a change and changing submitting a `PR` to the original repo.
