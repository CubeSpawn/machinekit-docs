.SH NAME
shuttlexpress \- control HAL pins with the ShuttleXpress device made by Contour Design
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIloadusr\fR \fBshuttlexpress\fR \fI[DEVICE ...]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
shuttlexpress is a userspace HAL component that interfaces Contour Design's
ShuttleXpress device with EMC2's HAL.  The ShuttleXpress has five momentary
buttons, a 10 count/revolution jog wheel with detents, and a 15-position
spring-loaded outer wheel that returns to center when released.
.PP
If it is started without command-line arguments, it will probe all
/dev/hidraw* device files for ShuttleXpress devices, and use all devices
found.  If it is started with command-line arguments, only will only
probe the devices specified.
.SH UDEV
The shuttlexpress module needs read permission on the /dev/hidraw*
device files.  This can be accomplished by adding a file
\fB/etc/udev/rules.d/99-shuttlexpress.rules\fR, with the following contents:

SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0b33", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0020", MODE="0444"

.SH A warning about the Jog Wheel
The ShuttleXpress device has an internal 8-bit counter for the current
jog-wheel position.  The shuttlexpress driver can not know this value
until the ShuttleXpress device sends its first event.  When the first
event comes into the driver, the driver uses the device's then-current
jog-wheel count as 0.

This means that if the first event is generated by a jog-wheel move,
that first move will be lost.

Any user interaction with the ShuttleXpress device will generate an event,
informing the driver of the jog-wheel position.  So if you (for example)
push one of the buttons at startup, the jog-wheel will work fine and
notice the first click.
