== Lathe

=== Default Plane

When EMC's interpreter was first written, it was designed for mills.
That is why the default plane is XY (G17). A normal lathe only uses the
XZ plane (G18). To change the default plane place the following line in
the .ini file in the RS274NGC section.

    RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE = G18

=== INI Settings

The following .ini settings are needed for lathe mode in addition to
or replacing normal settings in the .ini file.

    [DISPLAY]
    DISPLAY = axis
    LATHE = 1
    [TRAJ]
    AXES = 3
    COORDINATES = X Z
    [AXIS_0]
    ...
    [AXIS_2]
    ...
