\begin_layout Standard
EMC2 is capable of controlling a wide range of machinery using many different
 hardware interfaces.
 Stepconf is a program which generates EMC configuration files for a specific
 class of CNC machine: those connected to the PC using a standard 
\series bold
parallel port
\series default
 and controlled with 
\series bold
step & direction
\series default
 signals.
 Stepconf is installed when you install EMC2 and is in the CNC menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stepconf places a file in the emc2/config directory to store the choices
 for each configuration you create.
 When you change something you need to pick the file that matches your configura
tion name.
 The file extension is .stepconf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Stepconf Wizard needs at least 800 x 600 screen resolution to see the
 buttons on the bottom of the pages.

 Otherwise, find the 4 timing values in your driver's data sheet and enter
 them.
 
\newline
If the data sheet gives a value in microseconds, multiply by 1000.
 For example, enter 4.5us as 4500.
 A list is on the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url

 site of most popular drives with the timing values is in the Stepper Drive
 Timing Page.
\newline
Additional signal conditioning or isolation such as optocouplers
 and RC filters on break out boards can impose timing constraints of their
 own, in addition to those of the driver.
 You may find it necessary to add some time to the drive requirements to
 allow for this.
 The EMC Configuration Selector has configs for Sherline all ready configured.

\begin_layout Standard
While the test is running, you should "abuse" the computer.
 Move windows around on the screen.
 Surf the web.
 Copy some large files around on the disk.
 Play some music.
 Run an OpenGL program such as glxgears.
 The idea is to put the PC through its paces while the latency test checks
 to see what the worst case numbers are.
 
\series bold
Do not run EMC2 while the latency test is running.

\series default
 Run the test at least a few minutes.
 The longer you run the test the better it will be at catching events that
 might occour at less frequent intervals.
 This is a test for your computer only, so no hardware needs to be connected
 to run the test.

\begin_layout Standard
Latency is how long it takes the PC to stop what it is doing and respond
 to an external request.
 In our case, the request is the periodic "heartbeat" that serves as a timing
 reference for the step pulses.
 The lower the latency, the faster you can run the heartbeat, and the faster
 and smoother the step pulses will be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Latency is far more important than CPU speed.
 The CPU isn't the only factor in determining latency.
 Motherboards, video cards, USB ports, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl

target "nuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?FixingSMIIssues"

\end_inset

 issues, and a number of other things can hurt the latency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The important numbers are the "max jitter".
 In the example above 7085 nanoseconds is the highest jitter.
 Record this number, and enter it in the Base Period Maximum Jitter box.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your Max Jitter number is less than about 15-20 microseconds (15000-20000
 nanoseconds), the computer should give very nice results with software
 stepping.
 If the max latency is more like 30-50 microseconds, you can still get good
 results, but your maximum step rate might be a little disappointing, especially
 if you use microstepping or have very fine pitch leadscrews.
 If the numbers are 100uS or more (100,000 nanoseconds), then the PC is
 not a good candidate for software stepping.
 Numbers over 1 millisecond (1,000,000 nanoseconds) mean the PC is not a
 good candidate for EMC, regardless of whether you use software stepping
 or not.

 that the axis can decelerate to a stop before hitting the end of travel.
 If the switch is only closed for a short range of travel (instead of being
 closed from its trip point to one end of travel), this velocity must be
 chosen so that the axis can decelerate to a stop before the switch opens
 again, and homing must always be started from the same side of the switch.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Begin with a low Acceleration (e.g., 2 in/s^2 or 50mm/s^2) and the velocity
 you hope to attain.
 Using the buttons provided, jog the axis to near the center of travel.
 Take care because with a low acceleration value, it can take a surprising
 distance for the axis to decelerate to a stop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After gauging the amount of travel available, enter a safe distance in Test
 Area, keeping in mind that after a stall the motor may next start to move
 in an unexpected direction.
 Then click Run.
 The machine will begin to move back and forth along this axis.
 In this test, it is important that the combination of Acceleration and
 Test Area allow the machine to reach the selected Velocity and "cruise"
 for at least a short distance--the more distance, the better this test
 is.
 The formula d=.5*v*v/a gives the minimum distance required reach the specified
 velocity with the given acceleration.
 If it is convenient and safe to do so, push the table against the direction
 of motion to simulate cutting forces.
 If the machine stalls, reduce the speed and start the test again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the machine did not obviously stall, click the "Run" button off.
 The axis now returns to the position where it started.
 If the position is incorrect, then the axis stalled or lost steps during
 the test.
 Reduce Velocity and start the test again.

Finish the remaining steps of the configuration process, then launch EMC
 with your configuration.
 Turn the machine on and select the MDI tab.
 Start the spindle turning by entering: 
\family typewriter
M3 S100
\family default
.
 Change the spindle speed by entering a different S-number: 
\family typewriter
S800
\family default
.
 Valid numbers range from 1 to 1000.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For two different S-numbers, measure the actual spindle speed in RPM.
 Record the S-numbers and actual spindle speeds.
 Run Stepconf again.
 For "Speed" enter the measured speed, and for "PWM" enter the S-number
 divided by 1000.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, if your spindle will go from 0RPM to 8000RPM, but you generally
 use speeds from 400RPM to 4000RPM, then find the PWM values that give 1600RPM
 and 2800RPM.

\begin_layout Standard
For each axis, there is a limited range of travel.
 The physical end of travel is called the 
\series bold
hard stop
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before the 
\series bold
hard stop
\series default
 there is a 
\series bold
limit switch
\series default
.
 If the limit switch is encountered during normal operation, EMC shuts down
 the motor amplifier.
 The distance between the 
\series bold
hard stop
\series default
 and 
\series bold
limit switch
\series default
 must be long enough to allow an unpowered motor to coast to a stop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before the 
\series bold
limit switch
\series default
 there is a 
\series bold
soft limit
\series default
.
 This is a limit enforced in software after homing.
 If a MDI command, or g code program would pass the soft limit, it is not
 executed.
 If a jog would pass the soft limit, it is terminated at the soft limit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
home switch
\series default
 can be placed anywhere within the travel (between hard stops).
 As long as external hardware does not deactivate the motor amplifiers with
 the limit switch is reached, one of the limit switches can be used as a
 home switch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
zero position
\series default
 is the location on the axis that is 0 in the machine coordinate system.
 Usually the 
\series bold
zero position
\series default
 will be within the 
\series bold
soft limits
\series default
.
 On lathes, constant surface speed mode requires that machine

 correspond to the center of spindle rotation when no tool offset is in
 effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
home position
\series default
 is the location within travel that the axis will be moved to at the end
 of the homing sequence.
 This value must be within the 
\series bold
soft limits
\series default
.
 In particular, the 
\series bold
home position
\series default
 should never be exactly equal to a

A machine can be operated without limit switches.
 In this case, only the soft limits stop the machine from reaching the hard

 Soft limits only operate after the machine has been homed.

name "sub:Operating-without-Home"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A machine can be operated without home switches.
 If the machine has limit switches, but no home switches, it is best to
 use a limit switch as the home switch (e.g., choose 
\series bold
Minimum Limit + Home X
\series default
 in the pinout).
 If the machine has no switches at all, or the limit switches cannot be
 used as home switches for another reason, then the machine must be homed
 "by eye" or by using match marks.
 Homing by eye is not as repeatable as homing to switches, but it still
 allows the soft limits to be useful.

\begin_layout Standard
The ideal wiring for external switches would be one input per switch.
 However, the PC parallel port only offers a total of 5 inputs, while there
 are as many as 9 switches on a 3-axis machine.
 Instead, multiple switches are wired together in various ways so that a
 smaller number of inputs are required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figures below show the general idea of wiring multiple switches to a
 single input pin.
 In each case, when one switch is actuated, the value seen on INPUT goes
 from logic HIGH to LOW.
 However, EMC expects a TRUE value when a switch is closed, so the corresponding
 "Invert" box must be checked on the pinout configuration page.
