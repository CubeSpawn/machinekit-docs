= Point n Click Configurator Wizard[[cha:PNCconf-Wizard]]
(((PNCconf Wizard)))

The Point n Click Configurator covers Mesa cards and parallel port
stepper configurations. If you have a simple parallel port stepper
machine the StepConf Wizard might be a better choice. The Point n Click
Configurator can generate some advanced configurations without knowing
anything about HAL.

Start the PnCConf program from the CNC menu or from a terminal window
with `pncconf`. For more information on the terminal window see the
Linux FAQ section.
