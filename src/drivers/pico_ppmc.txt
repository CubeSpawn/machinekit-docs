= Pico PPMC

Pico Systems has a family of boards for doing analog servo, stepper,
and PWM (digital) servo control. The boards connect to the PC through a
parallel port working in EPP mode. Although most users connect one
board to a parallel port, in theory any mix of up to 8 or 16 boards can
be used on a single parport. One driver serves all types of boards. The
final mix of I/O depends on the connected board(s). The driver doesn't
distinguish between boards, it simply numbers I/O channels (encoders,
etc) starting from 0 on the first board.

Installing:

    loadrt hal_ppmc port_addr=<addr1>[,<addr2>[,<addr3>...]]

The `port_addr` parameter tells the driver what parallel port(s) to 
check. By default, `<addr1>` is 0x0378, and `<addr2>` and following 
are not used. The driver searches the entire address 
space of the enhanced parallel port(s) at `port_addr`, looking for 
any board(s) in the PPMC family. It then exports HAL 
pins for whatever it finds. During loading (or attempted loading) the 
driver prints some useful debugging messages to the kernel log, which 
can be viewed with `dmesg`. 

Up to 3 parport busses may be used, and each bus may have up to 8
devices on it.

== Pins

In the following pins, parameters, and functions, <board> is the board
ID. According to the naming conventions the first board should always
have an ID of zero. However, this driver sets the ID based on switches
on the board, so it may be non-zero even if there is only one board.

 - `(All s32 output) ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.count` -- Encoder
   position, in counts.
 - `(All s32 output) ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.delta` -- Change in
   counts since last read, in raw encoder count units.
 - (All float output) `ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.velocity`  --
   Velocity scaled in user units per second. On PPMC and USC this is
   derived from raw encoder counts per servo period, and hence is affected
   by encoder granularity. On UPC boards with the 8/21/09 and later
   firmware, velocity estimation by timestamping encoder counts can be
   used to improve the smoothness of this velocity output. This can be fed
   to the PID HAL component to produce a more stable servo response. This
   function has to be enabled in the HAL command line that starts the PPMC
   driver, with the timestamp=0x00 option.
 - `(All float output) ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.position` --
   Encoder position, in user units.
 - `(All bit bidir) ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.index-enable`  --
   Connect to axis.#.index-enable for home-to-index. This is a
   bidirectional HAL signal. Setting it to true causes the encoder
   hardware to reset the count to zero on the next encoder index pulse.
   The driver will detect this and set the signal back to false.
 -  `(PPMC float output) ppmc.<port>.DAC.<channel>.value` -- sends a
    signed value to the 16-bit Digital to Analog Converter on the PPMC DAC16
    board commanding the analog output voltage of that DAC channel.
 -  `(UPC bit input) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel>.enable` -- Enables a
   PWM generator.
 - `(UPC float input) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel>.value`  -- Value
   which determines the duty cycle of the PWM waveforms. The
   value is divided by `pwm.<channel>.scale`, and if the result is 0.6
   the duty cycle will be 60%, and so on. 
   Negative values result in the duty cycle being based on the absolute
   value, and the direction pin is set to indicate negative.
 - `(USC bit input) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel>.enable` --
   Enables a step pulse generator.
 - `(USC float input) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel>.velocity`  --
   Value which determines the step frequency. The value is multiplied
   by `stepgen.<channel>.scale` , and the result is the frequency in
   steps per second. Negative values
   result in the frequency being based on the absolute value, and the
   direction pin is set to indicate negative.
 - `(All bit output) ppmc.<port>.in-<channel>` -- State of digital
   input pin, see canonical digital input.
 - `(All bit output) ppmc.<port>.in.<channel>-not` -- Inverted
   state of digital input pin, see canonical digital input.
 - `(All bit input) ppmc.<port>.out-<channel>`  -- Value to be
   written to digital output, seen canonical digital output. 
 - `(Option float input) ppmc.<port>.DAC8-<channel>.value`  -- Value to
   be written to analog output, range from 0 to 255. This
   sends 8 output bits to J8, which should have a Spindle DAC board
   connected to it. 0 corresponds to zero Volts, 255 corresponds to 10
   Volts. The polarity of the output can be set for always minus, always
   plus, or can be controlled by the state of SSR1 (plus when on) and SSR2
   (minus when on). You must specify extradac = 0x00 on the HAL command
   line that loads the PPMC driver to enable this function on the first
   USC ur UPC board.
 - `(Option bit input) ppmc.<port>.dout-<channel>.out`  -- Value to be
   written to one of the 8 extra digital output pins on
   J8. You must specify extradout = 0x00 on the HAL command line that
   loads the ppmc driver to enable this function on the first USC or UPC
   board. extradac and extradout are mutually exclusive features as they
   use the same signal lines for different purposes.

== Parameters

 - `(All float) ppmc.<port>.enc.<channel>.scale` -- The number of
   counts / user unit (to convert from counts to units).
 - `(UPC float) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel-range>.freq` -- The PWM
   carrier frequency, in Hz. Applies to a group of four
   consecutive PWM generators, as indicated by `<channel-range>`. Minimum
   is 610Hz, maximum is 500KHz.
 -  `(PPMC float) ppmc.<port>.DAC.<channel>.scale`  -- Sets scale
   of DAC16 output channel such that an output value equal to the 1/scale
   value will produce an output of + or -- value Volts.  So, if the scale
   parameter is 0.1 and you send a value of 0.5, the output will be 5.0 Volts.
 -  `(UPC float) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel>.scale` -- Scaling for PWM
   generator. If `scale` is X, then the duty cycle will be 100% when the
   `value` pin is X (or -X).
 - `(UPC float) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel>.max-dc` -- Maximum duty
   cycle, from 0.0 to 1.0.
 - `(UPC float) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel>.min-dc` -- Minimum duty
   cycle, from 0.0 to 1.0.
 - `(UPC float) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel>.duty-cycle` -- Actual duty
   cycle (used mostly for troubleshooting.)
 - `(UPC bit) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel>.bootstrap` -- If true, the
   PWM generator will generate a short sequence of
   pulses of both polarities when E-stop goes false, to charge the
   bootstrap capacitors used on some MOSFET gate drivers.
 - `(USC u32) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel-range>.setup-time` -- Sets 
   minimum time between direction change and step pulse, in
   units of 100ns. Applies to a group of four consecutive PWM generators,
   as indicated by `<channel-range>`.
 - `(USC u32) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel-range>.pulse-width` -- Sets 
   width of step pulses, in units of 100ns. Applies to a group
   of four consecutive PWM generators, as indicated by `<channel-range>`.
 - `(USC u32) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel-range>.pulse-space-min` -- Sets 
   minimum time between pulses, in units of 100ns. The maximum step rate is 
   latexmath:[ \frac{1}{ ( 100ns * ( `pulse-width` + `pulse-space-min` )) } ]. 
   Applies to a group of four consecutive PWM generators, 
   as indicated by `<channel-range>`. 
 - `(USC float) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel>.scale` -- Scaling for
   step pulse generator. The step frequency in Hz is the
   absolute value of `velocity` * `scale`.
 - `(USC float) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel>.max-vel` -- The maximum
   value for `velocity`. Commands greater than `max-vel`  will be clamped.
   Also applies to negative values. (The absolute value is clamped.)
 - `(USC float) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel>.frequency` -- Actual
   step pulse frequency in Hz (used mostly for troubleshooting.)
 - `(Option float) ppmc.<port>.DAC8.<channel>.scale` -- Sets scale
   of extra DAC output such that an output value equal to
   scale gives a magnitude of 10.0 V output. (The sign of the output is
   set by jumpers and/or other digital outputs.)
 - `(Option bit) ppmc.<port>.out.<channel>-invert` -- Inverts a
   digital output, see canonical digital output.
 - `(Option bit) ppmc.<port>.dout.<channel>-invert` -- Inverts a
   digital output pin of J8, see canonical digital output.

== Functions

 - `(All funct) ppmc.<port>.read` -- Reads all inputs (digital inputs
   and encoder counters) on one port. These reads are organized into 
   blocks of contiguous registers to be read in a block to 
   minimize CPU overhead. 
 - `(All funct) ppmc.<port>.write` -- Writes all outputs (digital
   outputs, stepgens, PWMs) on one port. 
   These reads are organized into blocks of contiguous registers to be
   read in a block to minimize CPU overhead.
