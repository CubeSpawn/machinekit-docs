Parport
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parport is a driver for the traditional PC parallel port.
 The port has a total of 17 physical pins.
 The original parallel port divided those pins into three groups: data,
 control, and status.
 The data group consists of 8 output pins, the control group consists of
 4 pins, and the status group consists of 5 input pins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early 1990's, the bidirectional parallel port was introduced, which
 allows the data group to be used for output or input.
 The HAL driver supports the bidirectional port, and allows the user to
 set the data group as either input or output.
 If configured as output, a port provides a total of 12 outputs and 5 inputs.
 If configured as input, it provides 4 outputs and 13 inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some parallel ports, the control group pins are open collectors, which
 may also be driven low by an external gate.
 On a board with open collector control pins, the "x" mode allows a more
 flexible mode with 8 outputs, and 9 inputs.
 In other parallel ports, the control group has push-pull drivers and cannot
 be used as an input.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard
HAL cannot automatically determine if the "x" mode bidirectional pins are
 actually open collectors (OC).
 If they are not, they cannot be used as inputs, and attempting to drive
 them LOW from an external source can damage the hardware.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine whether your port has "open collector" pins, load hal_parport
 in "x" mode.
  With no device attached, HAL should read the pin as TRUE.
 Next, insert a 470
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 resistor from one of the control pins to GND.
 If the resulting voltage on the control pin is close to 0V, and HAL now
 reads the pin as FALSE, then you have an OC port.
 If the resulting voltage is far from 0V, or HAL does not read the pin as
 FALSE, then your port cannot be used in "x" mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The external hardware that drives the control pins should also use open
 collector gates (e.g., 74LS05).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On some machines, BIOS settings may affect whether "x" mode can be used.
 "SPP" mode is most most likely to work.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No other combinations are supported, and a port cannot be changed from input
 to output once the driver is installed.
 Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Parport-block-diag"

\end_inset

 shows two block diagrams, one showing the driver when the data group is
 configured for output, and one showing it configured for input.
  For "x" mode, refer to the pin listing of "halcmd show pin" for pin direction
 assignment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parport driver can control up to 8 ports (defined by MAX_PORTS in hal_parpor
t.c).
 The ports are numbered starting at zero.

Installing
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
loadrt hal_parport cfg="<config-string>"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Using the Port Index
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I/O addresses below 16 are treated as port indexes.
 This is the simplest way to install the parport driver and cooperates with
 the Linux parport_pc driver if it is loaded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
loadrt hal_parport cfg="0"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will use the address Linux has detected for parport0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Using the Port Address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The configure string consists of a hex port address, followed by an optional
 direction, repeated for each port.
 The direction is "in", "out", or "x" and determines the direction of the
 physical pins 2 through 9, and whether to create input HAL pins for the
 physical control pins.
 If the direction is not specified, the data group defaults to output.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
loadrt hal_parport cfg="0x278 0x378 in 0x20A0 out"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example installs drivers for one port at 0x0278, with pins 2-9 as outputs
 (by default, since neither "in" nor "out" was specified), one at 0x0378,
 with pins 2-9 as inputs, and one at 0x20A0, with pins 2-9 explicitly specified
 as outputs.
 Note that you must know the base address of the parallel port to properly
 configure the driver.
 For ISA bus ports, this is usually not a problem, since the port is almost
 always at a "well known" address, like 0278 or 0378 which is typically
 configured in the system BIOS.
 The address for a PCI card is usually shown in "lspci -v" in an "I/O ports"
 line, or in the kernel message log after executing 
\family typewriter
"sudo modprobe -a parport_pc
\family default
".
 There is no default address; if 
\family typewriter
<config-string>
\family default
 does not contain at least one address, it is an error.

\noun default
parport.<portnum>.pin-<pinnum>-in-not
\family default
 -- Tracks a physical input pin, but inverted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each pin, 
\family typewriter
<portnum>
\family default
 is the port number, and 
\family typewriter
<pinnum>
\family default
 is the physical pin number in the 25 pin D-shell connector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each physical output pin, the driver creates a single HAL pin, for example
 
\family typewriter
parport.0.pin-14-out
\family default
.
 Pins 2 through 9 are part of the data group and are output pins if the
 port is defined as an output port.
 (Output is the default.) Pins 1, 14, 16, and 17 are outputs in all modes.
 These HAL pins control the state of the corresponding physical pins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each physical input pin, the driver creates two HAL pins, for example
 
\family typewriter
parport.0.pin-12-in
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
parport.0.pin-12-in-not
\family default
.
 Pins 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 are always input pins.
 Pins 2 through 9 are input pins only if the port is defined as an input
 port.
 The 
\family typewriter
-in
\family default
 HAL pin is TRUE if the physical pin is high, and FALSE if the physical
 pin is low.
 The 
\family typewriter
-in-not
\family default
 HAL pin is inverted -- it is FALSE if the physical pin is high.
 By connecting a signal to one or the other, the user can determine the
 state of the input.
 In "x" mode, pins 1, 14, 16, and 17 are also input pins.

(bit) 
\noun default
parport.<portnum>.pin-<pinnum>-out-reset
\family default
 (only for "out" pins) -- TRUE if this pin should be reset when the

\family typewriter
reset
\family default
 function if it is enabled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
-invert
\family default
 parameter determines whether an output pin is active high or active low.
 If 
\family typewriter
-invert
\family default
 is FALSE, setting the HAL 
\family typewriter
-out
\family default
 pin TRUE drives the physical pin high, and FALSE drives it low.
 If 
\family typewriter
-invert
\family default
 is TRUE, then setting the HAL 
\family typewriter
-out
\family default
 pin TRUE will drive the physical pin low.

 -- Waits until 
\family typewriter

\family default
 settings.
 
\family typewriter

\family typewriter
write.
 
\family default
If 
\family typewriter
-reset
\family default
 is TRUE, then the 
\family typewriter
reset
\family default
 function will set the pin to the value of 
\family typewriter
-out-invert
\family default
.
 This can be used in conjunction with stepgen's 
\family typewriter
doublefreq
\family default
 to produce one step per period.
 The stepgen stepspace for that pin must be set to 0 to enable doublefreq.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The individual functions are provided for situations where one port needs
 to be updated in a very fast thread, but other ports can be updated in
 a slower thread to save CPU time.
 It is probably not a good idea to use both an 
\family typewriter
-all
\family default
 function and an individual function at the same time.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
then ensure that the standard kernel module 
\family typewriter
parport_pc
\family default
 is not loaded
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard
In the EMC packages for Ubuntu, the file /etc/modprobe.d/emc2 generally prevents
 
\family typewriter
parport_pc
\family default
 from being automatically loaded.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and that no other device in the system has claimed the I/O ports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the module loads but does not appear to function, then the port address
 is incorrect or the 
\family typewriter
probe_parport
\family default
 module is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Using DoubleStep
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To setup DoubleStep on the parallel port you must add the function parport.n.reset
 after parport.n.write and configure stepspace to 0 and the reset time wanted.
 So that step can be asserted on every period in HAL and then toggled off
 by parport after being asserted for time specificed by parport.n.reset-time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
loadrt hal_parport cfg="0x378 out"
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
setp parport.0.reset-time 5000
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
loadrt stepgen step_type=0,0,0
\end_layout

In modern PCs, the parallel port may require plug and play (PNP) configuration
 before it can be used.
 The
