= Tools and Utilities


== Halcmd[[sec:Halcmd]]

Halcmd is a command line tool for manipulating the HAL. There is a
rather complete man page for halcmd, which will be installed if you
have installed EMC2 from either source or a package. If you have
compiled EMC2 for “run-in-place”, the man page is not installed, but it
is accessible. From the main EMC2 directory, do:

+$ *man -M docs/man halcmd*+ 

Chapter <<cha:HAL-Tutorial>> has a number of examples of halcmd
usage, and is a good tutorial for halcmd.

== Halscope[[sec:Halscope]]

Halscope is an “oscilloscope” for the HAL. It lets you capture the
value of pins, signals, and parameters as a function of time. Complete
operating instructions should be located here eventually. For now,
refer to section  <<sec:Tutorial-Halscope>> in the tutorial chapter,
which explains the basics.
