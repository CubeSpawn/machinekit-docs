= Configuring Task and Iocontrol

== Iocontrol and user-defined Toolchange procedures

In the EMC2 releases so far, the only option for toolchange was to use the iocontrol
component. Iocontrol implements a fixed sequence of actions, some of
which can be parameterized by ini file options.

When using a user NGC procedure for toolchange, one would use
user-defined pins like motion.digital-in-XX and motion.digital-out-xx
to drive changer behaviour. This means that the corresponding
iocontrol pins (tool-change, tool-changed, tool-prepare, tool-pepared
etc) have no real function anymore.
