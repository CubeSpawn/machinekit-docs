= Stepper Configurations

This section assumes you have done a standard install from the Live
CD. After installation it is recommended that you connect the computer
to the Internet and wait for the update manager to pop up and get the
latest updates for EMC and Ubuntu before continuing. For more complex
installations see the Integrators Manual.

== Latency Test

The Latency Test determines how late your computer processor is in
responding to a request. Some hardware can interrupt the processing
which could cause missed steps when running a CNC machine. This is the
first thing you need to do. Follow the instructions in section (
<<sub:Latency-Test>>) to run the latency test.

== Sherline

If you have a Sherline several predefined configurations are provided.
This is on the main menu CNC/EMC then pick the Sherline configuration
that matches yours and save a copy.

== Xylotex [[sec:Sherline-and-Xylotex]]

If you have a Xylotex you can skip the following sections and go
straight to the Stepper Config Wizard in Section (
<<cha:Stepconf-Wizard>>). EMC has provided quick setup for the Xylotex
machines.

== Machine Information

Gather the information about each axis of your machine.

Drive timing is in nano seconds. If your unsure about the timing many
popular drives are included in the stepper configuration wizard. Note
some newer Gecko drives have different timing than the original one. A
list is also on the user maintained EMC wiki site of more drives at
http://wiki.linuxcnc.org[http://wiki.linuxcnc.org].

 |Axis | Drive Type | Step Time ns | Step Space ns | Direction Hold ns
| Direction Setup ns
|X |  |  |  |  | 
|Y |  |  |  |  |

|========================================

== Pinout Information

Gather the information about the connections from your machine to the
PC parallel port.

|========================================
 |Output Pin | Typical Function | If Different | Input Pin | Typical
Function | If Different
|1 | E-Stop Out |  | 10 | Both Limit & Home X | 
|2 | X Step |  | 11 | Both Limit & Home Y | 
|3 | X Direction |  | 12 | Both Limit & Home Z | 
|4 | Y Step |  | 13 | Both Limit & Home A | 
|5 | Y Direction |  | 15 | Probe In | 
|6 | Z Step |  |  |  | 
|7 | Z Direction |  |  |  | 
|8 | A Step |  |  |  | 
|9 | A Direction |  |  |  | 
|14 | Spindle CW |  |  |  | 
|16 | Spindle PWM |  |  |  | 
|17 | Amplifier Enable |  |  |  | 
|========================================

Note any pins not used should be set to Unused in the drop down box.
These can always be changed later by running Stepconf again.

== Mechanical Information

Gather information on steps and gearing. The result of this is steps
per user unit which is used for SCALE in the .ini file.

[width="90%", options="header"]
|========================================
 |Axis | Steps/Revolution | Micro steps | Motor Teeth | Leadscrew Teeth
| Leadscrew Pitch
| |  |  |  |  | 
| |  |  |  |  | 
| |  |  |  |  | 
| |  |  |  |  | 
|========================================

Steps per revolution is how many steps it takes to turn the stepper
one revolution.

Micro steps is how many steps the drive needs to move the stepper one
step.

Motor & Leadscrew Teeth is if you have some reduction between the
motor and the leadscrew. If not set these to 1.

Leadscrew pitch is how many turns it takes to move your table one user
unit. If your setting up in inches then it is turns per inch. If your
setting up in millimeters then how many turns per millimeter.

== Configuration Wizard

Run the Stepconf Wizard in chapter ( <<cha:Stepconf-Wizard>>)

== Modifying

To change something in the basic configuration created by Stepconf
Wizard run the wizard again. Select Modify a configuration... Then pick
the configuration file .stepconf you wish to modify in the emc2/configs
folder. The file headers tell you if the file can be manually edited or
not.
