= Probe Input

To use a probe input for G38 probing moves you first have to hook up
your probe to motion.probe-input. In this example we will use the
parallel port input pin 15. In your .hal file add a line like the
following making sure you pick the pin you have hooked your probe to.

net probe-in motion.probe-input <= parport.0.pin-15-in
