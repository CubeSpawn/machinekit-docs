== Use an appropriate decimal precision

Use at least 3 digits after the decimal when milling in millimeters,
and at least 4 digits after the decimal when milling in inches.

== Use consistent white space

G-code is most legible when at least one space appears before words.
While it is permitted to insert white space in the middle of numbers,
there is no reason to do so.

== Use Center-format arcs

Center-format arcs (which use 'I- J- K-' instead of 'R-' ) behave more
consistently than R-format arcs, particularly for
included angles near 180 or 360 degrees.

== Put important modal settings at the top of the file

When correct execution of your program depends on modal settings, be
sure to set them at the beginning of the part program. Modes can carry
over from previous programs and from the MDI commands.

As a good preventative measure, put a line similar to the following at
the top of all your programs:

----
G17 G20 G40 G49 G54 G80 G90 G94
----

(XY plane, inch mode, cancel diameter compensation, cancel length
offset, coordinate system 1, cancel motion, non-incremental motion,
feed/minute mode)

Perhaps the most critical modal setting is the distance units--If you
do not include G20 or G21, then different machines will mill the
program at different scales. Other settings, such as the return mode in
canned cycles may also be important.

== Don't put too many things on one line

Ignore everything in Section <<sec:Order-of-Execution>>, and instead
write no line of code that is the slightest bit ambiguous.

== Don't set & use a parameter on the same line

Don't use and set a parameter on the same line, even though the
semantics are well defined. Updating a variable to a new value, such as
'#1=[#1+#2'] is ok.

== Don't use line numbers

Line numbers offer no benefits. When line numbers are reported in
error messages, the numbers refer to the line number in the file, not
the N-word value.

== Linear and Rotary Axis

Because the meaning of an F-word in feed-per-minute mode varies
depending on which axes are commanded to move, and because the amount
of material removed does not depend only on the feed rate, it may be
easier to use G93 inverse time feed mode to achieve the desired
material removal rate.
