= AXIS

== Introduction

AXIS(((AXIS))) is a graphical front-end for EMC2 which features a live
preview and backplot. It is written in Python(((Python))) and uses
Tk(((Tk))) and OpenGL(((OpenGL))) to display its user interface.

.AXIS Window[[cap:AXIS-Window]]

image::images/axis_2.3.png[]

== Getting Started

If your configuration is not currently set up to use AXIS, 
you can change it by editing the .ini file. In the
section `[DISPLAY]` change the `DISPLAY` line to read

    DISPLAY = axis

The sample configuration
`sim/axis.ini` is already configured to use AXIS as its front-end.

=== A Typical Session

 . Start EMC.
 . Reset E-STOP (F1) and turn the Machine Power (F2) on.
 . Home all axes.
 . Load the g-code file.
 . Use the preview plot to verify that the program is correct.
 . Set the proper offset for each axis by jogging and using the Touch
   Off button.
 . Run the program.

== AXIS Display

The AXIS window contains the following elements:

 *  A display area that shows one of the following:
   ** a preview of the loaded file (in this case,
     "axis.ngc"), as well as the current location of the CNC(((CNC)))
     machine's "controlled point". Later, this area will display the path
     the CNC machine has moved through, called the "backplot"
   ** a large readout showing the current position and all offsets.
 * A menu bar and toolbar that allow you to perform various actions
 *  "Manual Control Tab" (((Manual))), which allows you to make the
   machine move, turn the spindle on or off, and turn the coolant on or
   off if included in the ini file.
 *  "MDI Tab” (((MDI))), where G-code programs can be entered manually,
   one line at a time. This also shows the "Active G Codes" which shows
   which modal G Codes are in effect.
 *  "Feed Override" (((feed override))), which allows you to scale
   the speed of programmed motions. The default maximum is 120% 
   and can be set to a different
   value in the ini file. See the Integrators Manual for more information
   on this setting.
 *  "Spindle Override" (((Spindle Override))), which allows you to
   scale the spindle speed up or down.
 *  "Jog Speed" (((Jog Speed))), which allows you to set the jog speed
   within the limits set in the ini file. See the Integrators Manual for
   more information on the ini file.
 *  "Max Velocity", which allows you to restrict the maximum velocity of all
   programmed motions (except spindle synchronized motion).
 * A text display area that shows the loaded G-Code.
 *  A status bar which shows the state of the machine. In this screen
   shot, the machine is turned on, does not have a tool inserted, and the
   displayed position is "Relative" (showing all offsets), and "Actual"
   (showing feedback position).

=== Menu Items

Some menu items might be grayed out depending on how you have your
.ini file configured. For more information on configuration see the
Integrators Manual.

==== File Menu

Open...::
     Opens a standard dialog box to open a g code file to load in AXIS. If
    you have configured EMC to use a filter program you can also open it
    up. See the Integrators manual for more information on filter programs.

Recent Files::
    Displays a list of recently opened files.

Edit...::
     Open the current g code file for editing if you have an editor
    configured in your ini file. See the Integrators Manual for more
    information on specifying an editor to use.

Reload::
     reload the current g code file. If you edited it you must reload it
    for the changes to take affect. If you stop a file and want to start
    from the beginning then reload the file. The toolbar reload is the same
    as the menu.

Save gcode as...::
    Save the current file with a new name.

Properties::
    Properties of the current loaded g code file.

Edit tool table...::
     Same as Edit if you have defined an editor you can open the tool table
    and edit it.

Reload tool table::
    After editing the tool table you must reload it.

Ladder editor::
     If you have loaded Classic Ladder you can edit it from here. See the
    Integrators Manual on setting up Classic Ladder

Quit::
    Terminates the current EMC session.

Zero Coordinate System::
    Clear (set to zero) a chosen offset.

Tool touch off to workpiece::
    When performing Touch Off, the value entered is relative to the current
    workpiece (`G5x`) coordinate system, as modified by the axis offset
    (`G92`).  When the Touch Off is complete, the Relative coordinate for
    the chosen axis will become the value entered.  (See also `G10 L10`)

Tool touch off to fixture::
    When performing Touch Off, the value entered is relative to the ninth
    (`G59.3`) coordinate system, with the axis offset (`G92`) ignored.  This is
    useful when there is a tool touch-off fixture at a fixed location on the
    machine, with the ninth (`G59.3`) coordinate system set such that the
    tip of a zero-length tool is at the fixture's origin when the Relative
    coordinates are 0.  (See also `G10 L11`)

=== Graphical Display Area

==== Coordinate Display

In the upper-left corner of the program display is the coordinate
display. It shows the position of the machine. To the left of the axis
name, an origin symbol (image:images/axis-homed.png[]) is shown if the
axis has been homed, and/or a limit
symbol (image:images/axis-limit.png[]) is shown if the axis is on one
of its limit switches.

To properly interpret these numbers, refer to the "Position:"
indicator in the status bar. If the position is "Absolute", then the
displayed number is in the machine coordinate system. If it is
"Relative", then the displayed number is in the offset coordinate
system. When the coordinates displayed are relative and an offset has
been set, the display will include a cyan "machine origin" marker
(image:images/axis-machineorigin.png[]). If the position is
"Commanded", then it is the ideal position--for instance, the exact
coordinate given in a `G0`  command. If it is "Actual", then it is the
position the machine has
actually moved to. These values can differ for several reasons:
Following error, dead band, encoder resolution, or step size. For
instance, if you command a movement to X 0.0033 on your mill, but one
step of your stepper motor or one encoder count is 0.00125, then the 
"Commanded" position will be 0.0033 but the "Actual" position will be 
0.0025 or 0.00375.

==== Preview Plot (((preview plot)))

When a file is loaded, a preview of it is shown in the display area.
Fast moves (such as those produced by the `G0`  command) are shown as
cyan lines. Moves at a feed rate (such as
 those produced by the `G1`  command) are shown as solid white lines.
Dwells (such as those
produced by the `G4` command) are shown as small pink "X" marks.

G0 (Rapid) moves prior to a feed move will not show on the preview
plot. Rapid moves after a T<n> (Tool Change) will not show on the 
preview until after the first feed move. To turn either of these features off
program a G1 without any moves prior to the G0 moves.

==== Program Extents (((program extents)))

The "extents" of the program in each axis are shown. At the ends, the
least and greatest coordinate values are indicated. In the middle, the
difference between the coordinates is shown. 

When some coordinates exceed the "soft limits" in the .ini file, the
relevant dimension is shown in a different color and enclosed by a box.
In Figure ( <<cap:Soft-Limit>>) the maximum soft limit is exceeded on
the X axis as indicated by the box surrounding the coordinate value.
The minimum X travel of the program is -1.95, the maximum X travel
is 1.88, and the program requires 3.83 inches of X travel.  To move
the program so it's within the machine's travel in this case, jog to
the left and Touch Off X again.

.Soft Limit[[cap:Soft-Limit]]

image::images/axis-outofrange.png[]

==== Tool Cone

When no tool is loaded, the location of the tip of the tool is
indicated by the "tool cone".

When a tool is loaded (for instance, with the MDI command `T1M6` ),
the cone changes to a cylinder which shows the diameter of the tool
given in the tool table file.

==== Backplot

When the machine moves, it leaves a trail called the backplot. The
color of the line indicates the type of motion: Yellow for jogs, faint
green for rapid movements, red for straight moves at a feed rate, and
magenta for circular moves at a feed rate.

==== Interacting

By left-clicking on a portion of the preview plot, the line will be
highlighted in both the graphical and text displays. By left-clicking
on an empty area, the highlighting will be removed.

By dragging with the left mouse button pressed, the preview plot will
be shifted (panned).

By dragging with shift and the left mouse button pressed, or by
dragging with the mouse wheel pressed, the preview plot will be
rotated. When a line is highlighted, the center of rotation is the
center of the line. Otherwise, the center of rotation is the center of
the entire program.

By rotating the mouse wheel, or by dragging with the right mouse
button pressed, or by dragging with control and the left mouse button
pressed, the preview plot will be zoomed in or out.

By clicking one of the "Preset View" icons, or by pressing "V",
several preset views may be selected.

=== Text Display Area

By left-clicking a line of the program, the line will be highlighted
in both the graphical and text displays.

When the program is running, the line currently being executed is
highlighted in red. If no line has been selected by the user, the text
display will automatically scroll to show the current line.

.Current and Selected Lines[[cap:Current-and-Selected]]

image::images/axis-currentandselected.png[]

=== Manual Control (((Manual)))


While the machine is turned on but not running a program, the items in
the "Manual Control" tab can be used to move the machine or control
its spindle and coolant.

When the machine is not turned on, or when a program is running, the
manual controls are unavailable.

Many of the items described below are not useful on all machines. When
AXIS detects that a particular pin is not connected in HAL, the
corresponding item in the Manual Control tab is removed. For instance,
if the HAL pin `motion.spindle-brake`  is not connected, then the
"Brake" button will not appear on the
 screen. If the environment variable `AXIS_NO_AUTOCONFIGURE` is set,
this behavior is disabled and all the items will appear.

==== The "Axis" group

"Axis" allows you to manually move the machine. This action is known
as "jogging". First, select the axis to be moved by clicking it. Then,
click and hold the "+" or "-" button depending on the desired direction
of motion. The first four axes can also be moved by the arrow keys (X
and Y), PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys (Z) and the [ and ] keys (A).

If "Continuous" is selected, the motion will continue as long as the
button or key is pressed. If another value is selected, the machine
will move exactly the displayed distance each time the button is
clicked or the key is pressed. By default, the available values are:

[quote]
________________________________________
0.1000, 0.0100, 0.0010, 0.0001
________________________________________


See the Configure section of the Integrators Manual for more
information on setting the increments.

==== Homing

If your machine has home switches and a homing sequence defined for
all axes the button will read "Home All". The "Home All" button or the
Ctrl-HOME key will home all axes using the homing sequence. Pressing
the HOME key will home the current axis, even if a homing sequence is
defined.

If your machine has home switches and no homing sequence is defined or
not all axes have a homing sequence the button will read "Home" and
will home the selected axis only. Each axis must be selected and homed
separately.

If your machine does not have home switches defined in the
configuration the "Home" button will set the current selected axis
current position to be the absolute position 0 for that axis and will
set the "is-homed" bit for that axis.

See the Integrators Manual for more information on homing.

==== Touch Off

By pressing "Touch Off" or the END key, the "G54 offset" for the
current axis is changed so that the current axis value will be the
specified value. Expressions may be entered using the rules for
rs274ngc programs, except that variables may not be referred to. The
resulting value is shown as a number.

.Touch Off[[cap:Touch-Off]]

image::images/touchoff.png[]

See also the `Tool touch off to workpiece` and `Tool touch off to fixture`
options in the Machine menu.

==== Override Limits

By pressing Override Limits, the machine will temporarily be allowed
to jog off of a physical limit switch. This check box is only available
when a limit switch is tripped.  The override is reset after one jog.  If
the axis is configured with separate positive and negative limit switches,
EMC will allow the jog only in the correct direction.  _Override Limits will
not allow a jog past a soft limit.  The only way to disable a soft limit 
on an axis is to Unhome it._

==== The "Spindle" group (((spindle)))

The buttons on the first row select the direction for the spindle to
rotate: Counterclockwise, Stopped, Clockwise. Counterclockwise will
only show up if the pin `motion.spindle-reverse` is in the hal file (it
can be `net trick-axis motion.spindle-reverse` ). The buttons on the
next row increase or decrease the rotation
speed. The checkbox on the third row allows the spindle brake to be
engaged or released. Depending on your machine configuration, not all
the items in this group may appear. Pressing the spindle start button
sets the "S" speed to 1.

==== The "Coolant" group (((coolant)))

The two buttons allow the "Mist" and "Flood" coolants to be turned on
and off. Depending on your machine configuration, not all the items in
this group may appear.

=== MDI

MDI(((MDI))) allows G-code commands to be entered manually.
When the machine is not turned on, or when a program is
running, the MDI controls are unavailable.

.The MDI tab[[cap:The-MDI-tab]]

image::images/axis_mdi.png[]

History:::
    This shows MDI commands that have been typed earlier in this session.

MDI Command:::
     This allows you to enter a g-code command to be executed. Execute the
    command by pressing Enter or by clicking "Go".

Active G-Codes:::
     This shows the "modal codes" that are active in the interpreter. For
    instance, "G54" indicates that the "G54 offset" is applied to all
    coordinates that are entered. When in Auto the Active G-Codes represent
    the codes after any read ahead by the interpreter.

=== Feed Override (((feed override)))

By moving this slider, the programmed feed rate can be modified. For
instance, if a program requests `F60` and the slider is set to 120%,
then the resulting feed rate will be 72.

=== Spindle Speed Override (((spindle speed override)))

By moving this slider, the programmed spindle speed can be
modified. For instance, if a program requests S8000 and the slider is
set to 80%, then the resulting spindle speed will be 6400. This item
only appears when the HAL pin `motion.spindle-speed-out` is connected.

=== Jog Speed (((jog speed))) 

By moving this slider, the speed of jogs can be modified. For
instance, if the slider is set to 1 in/min, then a .01 inch jog will
complete in about .6 seconds, or 1/100 of a minute. Near the left side
(slow jogs) the values are spaced closely together, while near the
right side (fast jogs) they are spaced much further apart, allowing a
wide range of jog speeds with fine control when it is most important.

On machines with a rotary axis, a second jog speed slider is shown.
This slider sets the jog rate for the rotary axes (A, B and C).

=== Max Velocity (((Max Velocity)))

By moving this slider, the maximum velocity can be set. This caps the
maximum velocity for all programmed moves except spindle-synchronized
moves.

== Keyboard Controls

Almost all actions in AXIS can be accomplished with the keyboard. A
full list of keyboard shortcuts can be found in the AXIS Quick
Reference, which can be displayed by choosing Help > Quick Reference.
Many of the shortcuts are unavailable when in MDI mode.

.Feed Override Keys

The Feed Override keys behave differently when in Manual Mode. The
keys `12345678 will select an axis if it is programed. If you have 3
axis then ` will select axis 0, 1 will select axis 1 and 2 will select
axis 2. The remainder of the number keys will still set the Feed
Override. When running a program `1234567890 will set the Feed Override
to 0% - 100%.

The most frequently used keyboard shortcuts are shown in Table 
<<cap:Most-Common-Keyboard>>.

|========================================

== Show EMC Status

AXIS includes a program called "emctop" which shows some of the
details of EMC's state. You can run this program by invoking Machine >
Show EMC Status

.EMC Status Window[[cap:EMC-Status-Window]]

image::axis-emctop.png[]

The name of each item is shown in the left column. The current value
is shown in the right column. If the value has recently changed, it is
shown on a red background.

== MDI interface

AXIS includes a program called "MDI" which allows text-mode entry of
MDI commands to a running EMC session. You can run this program by
opening a terminal and typing

    mdi /path/to/emc.nml

Once it is running, it displays the prompt `MDI>` . When a blank line
is entered, the machine's current position is
shown. When a command is entered, it is sent to EMC to be executed.

This is a sample session of mdi.

    $ mdi ~/emc2/configs/sim/emc.nml
    MDI>
    (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) 
    MDI> G1 F5 X1 
    MDI>  
    (0.5928500000000374, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) 
    MDI>  
    (1.0000000000000639, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

== axis-remote

AXIS includes a program called "axis-remote" which can send certain
commands to a running AXIS. The available commands are shown by running
`axis-remote ---help` and include checking whether AXIS is running
(`---ping`), loading a file by name, reloading the currently loaded
file (`---reload`), and making AXIS exit (`---quit`).

== Manual Tool Change
(((Manual Tool Change))) [[sec:Manual-Tool-Change]]

EMC2 includes a userspace hal component called "hal_manualtoolchange",
which shows a window (Figure  <<cap:The-Manual-Toolchange>>) when a
`M6`  command is issued. After the OK button is pressed, execution of
the
program will continue.

The HAL configuration file `configs/sim/axis_manualtoolchange.hal`
shows the HAL commands necessary to use this component.

hal_manualtoolchange can be used even when AXIS is not used as the
GUI. This component is most useful if you have presettable tools and
you use the tool table.

Important Note: Rapids will not show on the preview after a T<n> is
issued until the next feed move after the M6. This can be very
confusing to most users. To turn this feature off for the current tool
change program a G1 with no move after the T<n>.

.The Manual Toolchange Window[[cap:The-Manual-Toolchange]]

image::images/manualtoolchange.png[]

== Python modules 

AXIS(((AXIS))) includes several Python(((Python))) modules which may
be useful to others. For more information on one of these modules, use
`"pydoc <module name>"` or read the source code. These modules include:

 - `emc` provides access to the emc command, status, and error channels
 - `gcode` provides access to the rs274ngc interpreter
 - `rs274` provides additional tools for working with rs274ngc files
 - `hal` allows the creation of userspace HAL components written in Python
 -  `_togl` provides an OpenGL widget that can be used in Tkinter
   applications
 - `minigl` provides access to the subset of OpenGL used by AXIS

To use these modules in your own scripts, you must ensure that the
directory where they reside is on Python's module path. When running an
installed version of EMC2, this should happen automatically. When
running "in-place", this can be done by using
`scripts/emc-environment`.

== Lathe Mode

By including the line

    LATHE=1

in the [DISPLAY] section of the ini file, AXIS selects lathe mode. The
"Y" axis is not shown in coordinate readouts, the view is changed to
show the Z axis extending to the right and the X axis extending towards
the bottom of the screen, and several controls (such as those for
preset views) are removed.  The coordinate readouts for X are replaced
with diameter and radius.

Pressing "V" zooms out to show the entire file, if one is loaded.

When in lathe mode, the shape of the loaded tool (if any) is shown.

.Lathe Tool Shape[[cap:Lathe-Tool-Shape]]

image::axis-lathe-tool.png[]

== Advanced Configuration

For more information on ini file settings that can change how AXIS
works see the INI File/Sections/[DISPLAY] Section of Configuration
chapter in the Integrators manual.

=== Program Filters

AXIS has the ability to send loaded files through a "filter program".
This filter can do any desired task: Something as simple as making sure
the file ends with `M2`, or something as complicated as generating
G-Code from an image.

The `[FILTER]`  section of the ini file controls how filters work.
First, for each
 type of file, write a `PROGRAM_EXTENSION`  line. Then, specify the
program to execute for each type of file.
This program is given the name of the input file as its first argument,
and must write rs274ngc code to standard output. This output is what
will be displayed in the text area, previewed in the display area, and
executed by EMC when "Run". The following lines add support for the
"image-to-gcode" converter included with EMC2:

    [FILTER]
    PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .png,.gif Greyscale Depth Image
    png = image-to-gcode
    gif = image-to-gcode

It is also possible to specify an interpreter:

    PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .py Python Script
    py = python

In this way, any Python script can be opened, and its output is
treated as g-code. One such example script is available at
`nc_files/holecircle.py`. This script creates g-code for drilling a
series of holes along the
circumference of a circle.

.Circular Holes[[cap:Circular-Holes]]

image::holes.png[]

If the environment variable AXIS_PROGRESS_BAR is set, then lines
written to stderr of the form

    FILTER_PROGRESS=%d

will set the AXIS progress bar to the given percentage. This feature
should be used by any filter that runs for a long time.

=== The X Resource Database

The colors of most elements of the AXIS user interface can be
customized through the X Resource Database. The sample file
`axis_light_background`  changes the colors of the backplot window to a
"dark lines on white
background" scheme, and also serves as a reference for the configurable
 items in the display area. The sample file `axis_big_dro` changes the
position readout to a larger size font. To use these files:

    xrdb -merge /usr/share/doc/emc2/axis_light_background

    xrdb -merge /usr/share/doc/emc2/axis_big_dro

For information about the other items which can be configured in Tk
applications, see the Tk man pages.

Because modern desktop environments automatically make some settings
in the X Resource Database that adversely affect AXIS, by default these
settings are ignored. To make the X Resource Database items override
AXIS defaults, include the following line in your X Resources:

    *Axis*optionLevel: widgetDefault

this causes the built-in options to be created at the option level
"widgetDefault", so that X Resources (which are level "userDefault")
can override them.

===  [[sub:Physical-jog-wheels]]Physical jog wheels

To improve the interaction of AXIS with physical jog wheels, the axis
currently selected in the GUI is also reported on a pin with a name
like `axisui.jog.x`.  One of these pins is `TRUE` at one time, and the rest are
`FALSE`.  These are meant to control motion's jog-enable pins.

After AXIS has created these HAL pins, it executes the halfile named
in `[HAL]POSTGUI_HALFILE`. Unlike `[HAL]HALFILE`, only one such file
may be used.

=== axisrc (((.axisrc)))

If it exists, the contents of `~/.axisrc`  are executed as Python
source code just before the AXIS gui is
displayed. The details of what may be written in the axisrc are subject
to change during the development cycle.

The following adds Control-Q as a keyboard shortcut for Quit.

    root_window.bind("<Control-q>", "destroy .")
    help2.append(("Control-Q", "Quit"))

=== External Editor (((External Editor)))

The menu options File > Edit... and File > Edit Tool Table... become
available after defining the editor in the ini section [DISPLAY].
Useful values include EDITOR=gedit and EDITOR=gnome-terminal -e vim.
For more information, see the DISPLAY section of the INI Configuration
Chapter in the Integrators Manual.

=== Virtual Control Panel (((Virtual Control Panel)))

AXIS can display a custom virtual control panel in the right-hand
pane. You can program buttons, indicators, data displays and more. For
more information, see the Integrators Manual.

=== Special Comments (((Special Comments)))

Special comments can be inserted into the G Code file to control how
the preview of AXIS behaves. In the case where you want to limit the
drawing of the preview use these special comments. Anything between the
(AXIS,hide) and (AXIS,show) will not be drawn during the preview. The
(AXIS,hide) and (AXIS,show) must be used in pairs with the (AXIS,hide)
being first. Anything after a (AXIS,stop) will not be drawn during the
preview.

These comments are useful to unclutter the preview display (for
instance while debugging a larger g-code file, one can disable the
preview on certain parts that are already working OK).

 - (AXIS,hide) Stops the preview (must be first)
 - (AXIS,show) Resumes the preview (must follow a hide)
 - (AXIS,stop) Stops the preview from here to the end of the file.
