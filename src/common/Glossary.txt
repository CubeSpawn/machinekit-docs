= Glossary

A listing of terms and what they mean. Some terms have a general
meaning and several additional meanings for users, installers, and
developers.

Acme Screw::
     (((acme screw)))[[AcmeScrew]] A type of lead-screw that uses an acme
    thread form. Acme threads have somewhat lower friction and wear than
    simple triangular threads, but ball-screws are lower yet. Most manual
    machine tools use acme lead-screws.

Axis::
     (((axis)))[[Axis]] One of the computer control movable parts of the
    machine. For a typical vertical mill, the table is the X axis, the
    saddle is the Y axis, and the quill or knee is the Z axis. Additional
    linear axes parallel to X, Y, and Z are called U, V, and W
    respectively. Angular axes like rotary tables are referred to as A, B,
    and C.

Axis::
     (((GUI))) One of the Graphical User Interfaces available to users of
    EMC2. Features the modern use of menus and mouse buttons while
    automating and hiding some of the more traditional EMC2 controls. It is
    the only open-source interface that displays the entire tool path as
    soon as a file is opened. 

Backlash::
     (((backlash)))[[Backlash]] The amount of "play" or lost motion that
    occurs when direction is reversed in a lead screw. or other mechanical
    motion driving system. It can result from nuts that are loose on
    leadscrews, slippage in belts, cable slack, "wind-up" in rotary
    couplings, and other places where the mechanical system is not "tight".
    Backlash will result in inaccurate motion, or in the case of motion
    caused by external forces (think cutting tool pulling on the work
    piece) the result can be broken cutting tools. This can happen because
    of the sudden increase in chip load on the cutter as the work piece is
    pulled across the backlash distance by the cutting tool. 

Backlash Compensation::
     (((backlash compensation))) - Any technique that attempts to reduce
    the effect of backlash without actually removing it from the mechanical
    system. This is typically done in software in the controller. This can
    correct the final resting place of the part in motion but fails to
    solve problems related to direction changes while in motion (think
    circular interpolation) and motion that is caused when external forces
    (think cutting tool pulling on the work piece) are the source of the
    motion.

Ball Screw::
     (((ball screw)))[[Ballscrew]] A type of lead-screw that uses small
    hardened steel balls between the nut and screw to reduce friction.
    Ball-screws have very low friction and backlash, but are usually quite
    expensive.

Ball Nut::
     (((ball nut)))[[Ballnut]] A special nut designed for use with a
    ball-screw. It contains an internal passage to re-circulate the balls
    from one end of the screw to the other.

CNC::
     (((CNC)))[[CNC]] Computer Numerical Control. The general term used to
    refer to computer control of machinery. Instead of a human operator
    turning cranks to move a cutting tool, CNC uses a computer and motors
    to move the tool, based on a part program .

Comp::
     (((comp)))[[comp]] A tool used to build, compile and install EMC2 HAL
    components.

Configuration(n)::
     A directory containing a set of configuration files. Custom
    configurations are normally saved in the users home/emc2/configs
    directory. These files include EMC's traditional INI file and HAL
    files. A configuration may also contain several general files that
    describe tools, parameters, and NML connections.

Configuration(v)::
     The task of setting up EMC2 so that it matches the hardware on a
    machine tool.

Coordinate Measuring Machine::
     (((coordinate measuring machine))) A Coordinate Measuring Machine is
    used to make many accurate measurements on parts. These machines can be
    used to create CAD data for parts where no drawings can be found, when
    a hand-made prototype needs to be digitized for moldmaking, or to check
    the accuracy of machined or molded parts. 

Display units::
     (((display units))) The linear and angular units used for onscreen
    display.

DRO::
     (((DRO))) A Digital Read Out is a device attached to the slides of a
    machine tool or other device which has parts that move in a precise
    manner to indicate the current location of the tool with respect to
    some reference position. Nearly all DRO's use linear quadrature
    encoders to pick up position information from the machine. 

EDM::
     (((EDM))) EDM is a method of removing metal in hard or difficult to
    machine or tough metals, or where rotating tools would not be able to
    produce the desired shape in a cost-effective manner. An excellent
    example is rectangular punch dies, where sharp internal corners are
    desired. Milling operations can not give sharp internal corners with
    finite diameter tools. A wire EDM machine can make internal corners
    with a radius only slightly larger than the wire's radius. A 'sinker'
    EDM cam make corners with a radius only slightly larger than the radius
    on the corner of the convex EDM electrode. 

EMC::
     (((EMC)))[[EMC]] The Enhanced Machine Controller. Initially a NIST
    project. EMC is able to run a wide range of motion devices.

EMCIO::
     (((EMCIO)))[[EMCIO]] The module within EMC that handles general
    purpose I/O, unrelated to the actual motion of the axes.

EMCMOT::
     (((EMCMOT)))[[EMCMOT]] The module within EMC that handles the actual
    motion of the cutting tool. It runs as a real-time program and directly
    controls the motors.

Encoder::
     (((encoder)))[[Encoder]] A device to measure position. Usually a
    mechanical-optical device, which outputs a quadrature signal. The
    signal can be counted by special hardware, or directly by the parport
    with emc2.

Feed::
     (((feed)))[[Feed]] Relatively slow, controlled motion of the tool used
    when making a cut.

Feed rate::
     (((feed rate))) The speed at which a motion occurs. In manual mode,
    jog speed can be set from the graphical interface. In auto or mdi mode
    feed rate is commanded using a (f) word. F10 would mean ten units per
    minute.

Feedback::
     (((feedback)))[[Feedback]] A method (e.g., quadrature encoder signals)
    by which emc receives information about the position of motors

Feed rate Override::
     (((feed override)))[[FeedrateOveride]] A manual, operator controlled
    change in the rate at which the tool moves while cutting. Often used to
    allow the operator to adjust for tools that are a little dull, or
    anything else that requires the feed rate to be “tweaked”.

Floating Point Number::
    A number that has a decimal point. (12.300) In HAL it is known as float.

G-Code::
     (((G-Code)))[[G-Code]] The generic term used to refer to the most
    common part programming language. There are several dialects of G-code,
    EMC uses RS274/NGC.

    elements
        (widgets) on a computer screen.
    
    EMC;;
         An application that presents a graphical screen to the machine
        operator allowing manipulation of machine and the corresponding
        controlling program.

HAL::
     (((HAL)))[[HAL]] *H*ardware *A*bstraction *L* ayer. At the highest
    level, it is simply a way to allow a number of
    building blocks to be loaded and interconnected to assemble a complex
    system. Many of the building blocks are drivers for hardware devices.
    However, HAL can do more than just configure hardware drivers.

Home::
     (((home)))[[Home]] A specific location in the machine's work envelope
    that is used to make sure the computer and the actual machine both
    agree on the tool position.

ini file::
     (((INI)))[[inifile]] A text file that contains most of the information
    that configures EMC for a particular machine

Instance::
     (((Instance)))[[Instance]] One can have an instance of a class or a
    particular object. The instance is the actual object created at
    runtime. In programmer jargon, the Lassie object is an instance of the
    Dog class. 

Joint Coordinates::
     (((joint coordinates)))[[Joint_Coordinates]] These specify the angles
    between the individual joints of the machine. See also Kinematics

Jog::
     (((jog))) Manually moving an axis of a machine. Jogging either moves

    constant speed as long as you hold down the key.

kernel-space::
    [[kernel-space]] See real-time.

Kinematics::
     (((kinematics)))[[Kinematics]] The position relationship between world
    coordinates and joint coordinates of a machine. There are two types of
    kinematics. Forward kinematics is used to calculate world coordinates
    from joint coordinates. Inverse kinematics is used for exactly opposite
    purpose.Note that kinematics does not take into account, the forces,
    moments etc. on the machine. It is for positioning only.

Lead-screw::
     (((lead screw)))[[Leadscrew]] An screw that is rotated by a motor to
    move a table or other part of a machine. Lead-screws are usually either
    ball-screws or acme screws, although conventional triangular threaded
    screws may be used where accuracy and long life are not as important as
    low cost.

Machine units::
     (((machine units))) The linear and angular units used for machine
    configuration. These units are used in the inifile. HAL pins and
    parameters are also generally in machine units.

MDI::
     (((MDI)))[[MDI]] Manual Data Input. This is a mode of operation where
    the controller executes single lines of G-code as they are typed by the
    operator.

Python::
     General-purpose, very high-level programming language. Used in EMC2
    for the Axis GUI, the Stepconf configuration tool, and several G-code
    programming scripts.

Rapid::
     (((rapid)))[[Rapid]] Fast, possibly less precise motion of the tool,
    commonly used to move between cuts. If the tool meets the material
    during a rapid, it is probably a bad thing!

Real-time::
     (((real-time))) [[real-time]] Software that is intended to meet very
    strict timing deadlines. Under Linux, in order to meet these
    requirements it is necessary to install RTAI or RTLINUX and build the
    software to run in those special environments. For this reason
    real-time software runs in kernel-space.

RTAI::
     (((RTAI)))[[RTAI]] Real Time Application Interface, see
    https://www.rtai.org/[https://www.rtai.org/], one of two real-time
    extensions for Linux that EMC can use to achieve real-time performance.

    negitive sign. (-12) In HAL it is known as s32.

Spindle::
     (((spindle)))[[Spindle]] On a mill or drill, the spindle holds the
    cutting tool. On a lathe, the spindle holds the workpiece.

Spindle Speed Override::
     A manual, operator controlled change in the rate at which the tool
    rotates while cutting. Often used to allow the operator to adjust for
    chatter caused by the cutter's teeth. Spindle Speed Override assume
    that the EMC2 software has been configured to control spindle speed.

Stepconf::
     An EMC2 configuration wizard. It is able to handle many
    step-and-direction motion command based machines. Writes a full
    configuration after the user answers a few questions about the computer
    and machine to be run with.

Stepper Motor::
     (((stepper motor)))[[StepperMotor]] A type of motor that turns in
    fixed steps. By counting steps, it is possible to determine how far the
    motor has turned. If the load exceeds the torque capability of the
    motor, it will skip one or more steps, causing position errors.

TASK::
     (((TASK)))[[TASK]] The module within EMC that coordinates the overall
    execution and interprets the part program.

Tcl/Tk::

    it is known as u32.

World Coordinates::
     (((world coordinates)))[[World_Coordinates]] This is the absolute
    frame of reference. It gives coordinates in terms of a fixed reference
    frame that is attached to some point (generally the base) of the
    machine tool.
