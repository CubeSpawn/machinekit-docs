Upgrading EMC2
==============

The following instructions only apply to Ubuntu 8.04 "Hardy 
Heron". EMC 2.4 is not available for older releases of Ubuntu.

Because there are several minor incompatibilities between 2.3.5 
and 2.4.x, your existing install will not automatically be 
updated to 2.4.x. If you want to run 2.4.x, change to the EMC-2.4 
repository by following these instructions:

run System/Administration/Synaptic Package Manager

go to Settings/Repositories

In the list of Third-Party software there should be at least two 
lines for linuxcnc.org.

For each of them:

 - Select the line and click Edit

 - on the Components line, change emc2.3 to emc2.4

 - Click OK 

 - Close the "Software Preferences" window

 - Click "Reload" as instructed

 - Click "Mark All Upgrades"
   
   If you use a mesa card, find the proper hostmot2-firmware package 
   for your card and mark it for installation. Hint: do a search for 
   "hostmot2-firmware in the synaptic package manager.

 - Click "Apply" 

== Changes between 2.3.x and 2.4.x

Once you have done the upgrade, update any custom configurations 
by following these instructions:

=== emc.nml changes 

For configurations that have not customized emc.nml, remove the 
inifile line NML_FILE = emc.nml. This will cause the most up to 
date version of emc.nml to be used.

For configurations that have customized emc.nml, a change similar 
to this one is required.

Failure to do this can cause an error like 
`libnml/buffer/physmem.cc 143: PHYSMEM_HANDLE: Can't write 10748 
bytes at offset 60 from buffer of size 10208.`

=== tool table changes 

The format of the tool table has been changed incompatibly. The 
documentation shows the new format. The tool table will 
automatically be converted to the new format.

=== hostmot2 firmware images 

The hostmot2 firmware images are now a separate package. You can:

 - Continue using an already-installed `emc2-firmware-mesa-*` 2.3.x 
   package

 - Install the new packages from the synaptic package manager. The 
   new packages are named `hostmot2-firmware-*`

 - Download the firmware images as tar files from 
   http://emergent.unpy.net/01267622561 and install them manually
