\begin_layout Chapter
About EMC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
EMC (the Enhanced Machine Control) is a software system for computer control
 of machine tools such as milling machines and lathes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
EMC is free software with open source code.
 Current versions of EMC are entirely licensed under the GNU General Public
 License and Lesser GNU General Public License (GPL and LGPL)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
EMC provides:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
a graphical user interface (actually several interfaces to chose from)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
an interpreter for "G-code" (the RS-274 machine tool programming language)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a realtime motion planning system with look-ahead
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
operation of low-level machine electronics such as sensors and motor drives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
an easy to use "breadboard" layer for quickly creating a unique configuration
 for your machine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a software PLC programmable with ladder diagrams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
easy installation with a Live-CD
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It does not provide drawing (CAD - Computer Aided Design) or G-code generation
 from the drawing (CAM - Computer Automated Manufacturing) functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It can simultaneously move up to 9 axes and supports a variety of interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The control can operate true servos (analog or PWM) with the feedback loop
 closed by the EMC software at the computer, or open loop with "step-servos"
 or stepper motors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Motion control features include: cutter radius and length compensation,
 path deviation limited to a specified tolerance, lathe threading, synchronized
 axis motion, adaptive feedrate, operator feed override, and constant velocity
 control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support for non-Cartesian motion systems is provided via custom kinematics
 modules.
 Available architectures include hexapods (Stewart platforms and similar
 concepts) and systems with rotary joints to provide motion such as PUMA
 or SCARA robots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
EMC runs on Linux using real time extensions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Operating System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ubuntu has been chosen, because it fits perfectly into the Open Source views
 of EMC2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ubuntu will always be free of charge, and there is no extra fee for the
 "enterprise edition", we make our very best work available to everyone
 on the same Free terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
EMC is paired with the LTS versions of Ubuntu which provide support and
 security fixes from the Ubuntu team for 3 - 5 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ubuntu uses the very best in translations and accessibility infrastructure
 that the Free Software community has to offer, to make Ubuntu usable for
 as many people as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Ubuntu community is entirely committed to the principles of free software
 development; we encourage people to use open source software, improve it
 and pass it on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Getting Help
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
IRC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat.
 It is a live connection to other EMC users.
 The EMC IRC channel is #emc on freenode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest way to get on the IRC is to use the embedded java client on
 this page 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
target "http://www.linuxcnc.org/content/view/4/8/lang,en/"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some IRC etiquette:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ask specific questions...
 Avoid "Can someone help me?", "It won't run" type of questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you're really new to all this, think a bit about your question before
 typing it.
 Make sure you give enough information so someone can solve your question.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Have some patience when waiting for an answer, sometimes it takes a while
 to formulate an answer or everyone might be busy working or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Set up your IRC account with your unique name so people will know who you
 are.
 If you use the java client, use the same name every time you log in.
 This helps people remember who you are and if you have been on before many
 will remember the past discussions which saves time on both ends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sharing Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common way to share files on the IRC is to upload the file to one
 of the following or a similar service and paste the link:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
http://pastebin.ca = for text 
\newline
http://imagebin.ca = for pictures
\newline
http://filebin.ca
 = for files and pdfs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mailing List
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An Internet Mailing List is a way to put questions out for everyone on that
 list to see and answer at their convenience.
 You get better exposure to your questions on a mailing list than on the
 IRC but answers take longer.
 In a nutshell you e-mail a message to the list and either get daily digests
 or individual replies back depending on how you set up your account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Burning the CD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EMC2 is distributed as CD image files, called ISOs.
 To install EMC2, you first need to burn the ISO file onto a CD.
 You need a working CD/DVD burner and an 80 minute (700 Mb) CD for this.
 If the CD writing fails, try writing at a slower burn speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Burn with Linux
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before burning a CD, it is highly recommended that you verify the md5 sum
 (hash) of the .iso file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open a terminal window.
 In Ubuntu it is Applications/Accessories/Terminal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Change to the directory where the ISO was downloaded to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\series bold
cd download_directory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The run the md5sum command with the file name you saved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\series bold
md5sum ubuntu-8.04-desktop-emc2-aj07-i386.iso
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The md5sum should print out a single line after calculating the hash.
 On slower computers this might take a minute or two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\series bold
91c5abb84386091e0ff056e9ebc40fdb ubuntu-8.04-desktop-emc2-aj07-i386.iso
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now compare it to the md5sum on the EMC2 download page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Burning the ISO to a CD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Insert a blank CD into your burner.
 A "CD/DVD Creator" or "Choose Disc Type" window will pop up.

Browse to the downloaded ISO image in the file browser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Right click on the ISO image file and choose Write to Disc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Select the write speed.
 If you are burning a Ubuntu Live CD, it is recommended that you write at
 the lowest possible speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start the burning process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If a choose a file name for the disc image window pops up just pick OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Burn with Windows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before burning a CD, it is highly recommended that you verify the md5 sum
 (hash) of the .iso file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Windows does not come with a md5sum program.
 You will have to download and install one to check the md5sum.

With the normal install the Update Manager will notify you of updates to
 EMC2 when you go on line and allow you to easily upgrade with no Linux
 knowledge needed.
 If you want to upgrade to 10.04 from 8.04 a clean install from the Live-CD
 is needed.
 It is OK to upgrade EMC when asked to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Warning: Do not upgrade Ubuntu to a new version (like 8.04 to 8.10) as it
 will prevent EMC from running.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
