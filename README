How to add a new translation language
-------------------------------------

Add the asciidoc source files that will contain your new translation.
Usually that means copying the language files for one of the existing
languages, probably English since that's usually the most up to date.

Add the new files to the proper place in docs/src/Submakefile, to ensure
they'll get built.

Edit debian/control.in to add the new emc2-doc-$NEWLANG package.  Add the new
doc package to the or-list of the Recommends line of the emc2/emc2-sim
package.

Add the new language to the DOCS_PACKAGES variable in debian/configure.

Add the 'emc2-doc-$NEWLANG.files.in' file for the new package, probably
by copying and editing "debian/emc2-doc-en.files.in".

Test build the packages and verify!
