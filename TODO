To Do 

*** All Manuals

Fix missing code sections. During the doc conversion to asciidoc any place
that had a <code> tag in the lyx file the code was deleted. You can copy
and paste the code from the 2.4 pdf manuals. 

Remove items from this list as you fix.

If you prefix code sections with [source,xml] or [source,c]
you will get the source code highlighting.

I made some minor changes but I never really found the trouble here. 
What is it complaining about?  KimK
