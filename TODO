To Do 

*** All Manuals

	Are they printing (pdf) too close to the right edge for some printers? 
	(Looks on-screen like less than 1/2", maybe 3/8". is that enough?)
	(Yes, pdf can "print to fit", but still, why be wrong to start with?)
	(Also, possible issues if printed duplex and punched? Usual 3/4" margin?)

	Is the overall font size (pdf) too small? (I'd like to see us come up to 
	about the same font size we had on the old manuals, if that's possible?) 

	At least some (all?) chapter-links (non-internet links, circled in red) are broken in pdf?
	(If I hover the old manuals, it says "Go to page 10, 15, 20, whatever")
	(If I hover the new manuals, it says "Go to page i", the front cover)
	(The table of contents works in pdf, and everything works in html.)
